Oi, eu sou sbmcNULL1296
eu apenas estou seguindo as ordens do alura, entÃ£o tÃ©cnicamente isso nÃ£o Ã© uma conta de verdade e vocÃªs podem ignorÃ¡-la
<!--
**sbmc196/sbmc196** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Nothing at all (only doing alura stuff wich is boring BTW)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nothing, only rushing throught alura's works
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to kil... how to quickly do my stuff until may 4th to something special
- âš¡ Fun fact: SBMC is dead and  my NULL(sbmc.xmlnotfound) is SBMC but with a physical corrupted body
